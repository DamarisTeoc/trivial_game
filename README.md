# About the project
Trivial is part of one of the Factoria F5 Bootcamp projects. The main goals of it are :

- To acquire the ability to create a functional  trivial game support app using Vue3.
- How to consume an API with axios.

# What is Trivial about?
Trivial Pursuit is a Canadian board game in which winning is determined by a player's ability to answer general knowledge and popular culture questions.The object of the game is to collect all six wedges from each "category headquarters" space, and then return to the center "hub" space to answer a question in a category selected by the other players.

With this app you won't need the physical cards to see the questions, because you can see them on the app.

You can choose wich category you want the question to be.
